TODO:

- auto&
- error location mapping in the source code
- better GUI
- ??? crash handling on loading of the plugin
- something more interesting should happen in the background for the demo
- document the API - like any specifics for each call
- stress test everything (+unit tests for the parsing function of vars)
- make a demo video showcasing the project
- blog about it (with all the notes in my .txt file in google drive)
