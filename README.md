TODO:

- change between the 3 section types with comments
- better GUI
- clean project build from warnings on higher levels
- document the API - like any specifics for each call
- redirect the output temporarily while loading the lib
- something more interesting should happen in the background for the demo
- parameterize which headers should be included
- stress test everything (+unit tests for the parsing function of vars)
- test under linux/osx (currently only compiles)
- add a PCH through cmake
- make a demo video showcasing the project
- blog about it (with all the notes in my .txt file in google drive)
